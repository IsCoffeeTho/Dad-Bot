### Jokes
When adding a joke, please also explain the joke in the `explain` field

e.g:
```json
{
	"joke": [
		"I'm afraid for the calendar.",
		"Its days are numbered."
	],
	"explain": "The calendar shows the days as a number of the month"
}
```

I'll be having my dad mode on when i review your pull request so it better be good.
